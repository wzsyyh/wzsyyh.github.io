        I am an undergraduate student at Westlake University, currently in my second year of Artificial Intelligence studies. As a member of the AGI Lab, I focus on research in AI Agent and 3D/video generation.

        My current research interests include:
        - **AI Agent Systems**: Developing intelligent agents that can understand and interact with complex academic content
        - **3D/Video Generation**: Exploring novel approaches to generate high-quality 3D content and videos
        - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Designing collaborative agent frameworks for complex tasks
        - **Educational Technology**: Creating tools that enhance learning and knowledge transfer

        I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence while ensuring practical applications in education and research. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration! 😃
